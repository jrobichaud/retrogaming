Audio
=====

The volume of the TV can be adjusted using the :ref:`keypad`. It will trigger an automation that will change the volume using :ref:`cec`. This part is mostly for my kids.

I use mostly my headphones.

The :ref:`soundblaster` is used connect the TV to the :ref:`audio_mixer` using an optic cable.

The audio mixer is used to mix the audio from the :ref:`secondary Chromecast <cast>` with the audio of the TV. I can also adjust their respective volumes.

These two devices are powered on automatically by a :ref:`Smart Plug <smart_plugs>` when the TV is powered on by any of the automations.
