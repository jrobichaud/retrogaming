SNES,9V,7.65W,,"Non-standard jack, I used a :ref:`barrel jack to snes adapter <snes_2_barrel_jack>`. It also has an inverted polarity so I used a :ref:`barrel_jack_reverse_polarity`. I made my own cable using :ref:`usb_c_9v_power_trigger` soldered to a male barrel jack.",It has a 9V with inverted polarity. I could have soldered the sned plug directly to an usbc-c trigger but I decided not to.
