Products Used
=============

This is a list of the products used in the project.


.. _hdmi_switch:

HDMI Switch
-----------

I use the FiveHome 6 Port HDMI 2.0 Switcher I bought from `Amazon CA <https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B076XWNQP9?th=1>`_.

It cannot be controlled via CEC, it has to be controlled with IR or with a physical button.

It appears to be incompatible with the Retrotink 4K.


.. _hydra:

Hydra 2 Revised
---------------

Automatic SCART switch with 8 inputs and 2 output.

`shop <https://lotharek.pl/productdetail.php?id=290>`_

.. _keypad:

Keypad
------

Its a 3d printed keypad with 16 keys I bought from `Etsy <https://www.etsy.com/ca/listing/1031708108/zmk-16-hotswap-mechanical-macropad>`_.

I mapped the keys from F1 to F16.

I used a PTouch label maker to label the keys.


.. _retrotink_4k:

Retrotink 4K
------------

Upscaler for retro consoles. Upscales video up to 4K.

`shop <https://www.retrotink.com/product-page/retrotink-4k>`_
