.. _hdmi_switch:

HDMI Switch
-----------

I use the FiveHome 6 Port HDMI 2.0 Switcher I bought from `Amazon CA <https://www.amazon.ca/dp/B076XWNQP9?th=1>`_.

It cannot be controlled via CEC, it has to be controlled with IR or with a physical button.

It appears to be incompatible with the Retrotink 4K.
